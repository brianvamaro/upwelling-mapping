# Automatic Mapping of Coastal Upwelling

## Overview 
This repository contains code and resources for automatically mapping coastal upwelling events off the California coast. The approach uses MODIS Sea Surface Temperature data and a modified topographic position index algorithm to detect and segment areas of significantly colder water, indicating upwelling events.
